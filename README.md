## About The Project

This project is a simple game to test the Monty Hall problem. It was made with Next.js and Typescript.

The project was made following the course of professor Leonardo Moura Leitao from Cod3r. The course is called "Next.js & React - Complete Course" and can be found [here](https://www.udemy.com/course/nextjs-e-react/).

### What is the Monty Hall problem?

The Monty Hall problem is a brain teaser, in the form of a probability puzzle, loosely based on the American television game show Let's Make a Deal and named after its original host, Monty Hall. 

The game show host, Monty Hall, presents the player with three closed doors, behind which are either a car or a goat. The player chooses a door and the host opens one of the remaining doors, which he knows has a goat behind it. The player is then given the option to switch to the other closed door or stay with their initial choice. The player wins the car if they chose the door with the car behind it, otherwise they win nothing.

The trick of the problem is that the host knows where the car is and will always open a door with a goat. If the player initially selected the door with a car, the host can open either of the two remaining doors. If the player initially selected a door with a goat, the host can only open the other door with a goat. In both cases, the host will reveal a goat and offer the player the option to switch their choice of door.

The correct strategy is to always switch doors, which results in a 2/3 chance of winning the car, versus 1/3 for not switching doors.
